        "There were cafes selling croissants with apricot jams, mall-like areas glowing with chocolates wrapped in gold foils and “I heart Berlin” refrigerator magnets, and baristas with hair back in long, rope-like braids serving German beers in warm glasses. But there were no power outlets to be found." -- Thoughts from the SFX Airport, Day 1

        Welcome to my ethnography (of sorts) on behavior and technology in Berlin! Together we will glance at the 82.29 million Germans, their 79.12 million Internet users (that's 96.2% of the population!), 31 million Facebook subscribers, and 100 million mobile phones as well as crosswalks, fake names, friends, and other details. In order to get the full experience of this website, you might have to explore a bit (I know, it's terrifying, but I had to do that for 9 weeks in Berlin when I didn't speak a word of German, so really you're getting off easy here.) If you're looking to cut to the chase (a meandering narrative of <a target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/greenletters596/">yours truly over seas</a>) then <a href = "doc/BerlinEthnography.pdf" download> click here </a> to download my full ethnography.

            "To put it lightly, crosswalks are taken very seriously. It can be an empty road, in the middle of the night, so quiet and so still that one could take a nap in the middle of the street. Yet Germans will not cross the street until they see the red figure turn into a green figure. It is nonnegotiable." -- Thoughts while walking. <br /><br /> In the United States, crossing the street is signaled by three different things: a green light, a flashing red light, and a red light. The flashing red allows for an area of uncertainty, meaning pedestrians will have to think about whether or not it is safe to start crossing the street. <br /><br /> <span class="moretext">  In Germany, there are only two lights: green and red. There is no area of uncertainty. As result, pedestrian injury rates in the United States are about twice as high as they are in Germany, and cyclist injury rates are about 6 times higher in the United States. <br /> <br/> Waiting at crosswalks in Germany might have been a little bit annoying, but the rule-following ways of the Germans did grow on me. Mostly because you didn't have to think -- you just cross when you're told. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=dp_ob_image_bk" target="blank"> And isn't that what good user experience is all about? </a> <br /><br />   </span>

        "It felt like I couldn’t be more than a 15-minute walk from a train station if I tried. Trains came very frequently, even late at night, and buying tickets took less than a minute. It was brilliant. And liberating." -- Thoughts from underground.<br /> <br/> Trains in Germany transport about 2.6 billion passengers per year, and in 2017, German public transport carried over 5.8 billion passengers. For comparison, Americans took 10.1 billion public transportation trips in 2017, and the United States is 28 times bigger than Germany. <br /> <br/> Although some train stations in Berlin had free WiFi, the space between train stations did not. There was virtually no cell service underground, which meant phones couldn't offer much entertainment for passengers. Germans aren't the chatty type, so for all the time they spent riding trains, they usually spent listening to music through headphones, napping, or staring into space.<br /> <br/> I don't blame them. Trains were noisy in a muted way, and sometimes uncomfortably warm. It was a good time to be alone with your thoughts. In this way, I took a liking to the German sense of personal space and privacy in public spaces.

        "The paranoia of German citizens was more interesting to me than the actual German Internet laws. Legally speaking, Germany’s internet is just as “free” as the United States." -- Thoughts from a big-windowed cafe.<br /> <br/> Germans are big fans privacy and security. It's not uncommon for people to use fake names on their social media platforms to make themselves "unsearchable." There is also a general concern about internet activity being monitored, and for good reason. It's common for people to receive fines in the mail for pirating movies or streaming any kind of illegal content. There are even legal services to help protect against these fines.<br /> <br/> While Germany and the United States have many similar laws regarding the internet, it seems Germany is much more active in enforcing laws. Germans seem to find the internet to be a much scarier place in general. They spend significantly more money than other countries on data protection and things such as spam-blockers and firewalls.
